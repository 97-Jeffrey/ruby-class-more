GoodDog.new

# when initializing a object, "GoodDog" is printed

# self, inside of an instance method, references the instance (object) that called the method - the calling object. Therefore, self.weight= is the same as sparky.weight=, in our example.

# self, outside of an instance method, references the class and can be used to define class methods. Therefore if we were to define a name class method, def self.name=(n) is the same as def GoodDog.name=(n).
